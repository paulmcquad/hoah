=== Unix / BSD Kernel

A Unix kernel — the core or key components of the operating system — consists of many kernel subsystems like process management, scheduling, file management, device management, network management, memory management, and dealing with interrupts from hardware devices.<<kernel-unix>>
(((BSD)))

A Berkeley Software Distribution kernel is a free kernel based on the Unix kernel. The term "BSD" commonly refers to its open-source descendants, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD.<<kernel-bsd>>

=== Unix-like Kernels


==== Oracle Solaris
Oracle Solaris is a Unix-like Kernel. Historically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software. In June 2005, Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. OpenSolaris was renamed Oracle Solaris in 2010. OpenSolaris project was forked to Illumos.<<kernel-solaris>>
(((Illumos)))

==== Illumos
Illumos (stylized as illumos) is a partly free and open-source Unix operating system. It is based on OpenSolaris, which was based on System V Release 4 (SVR4) and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Illumos comprises a kernel, device drivers, system libraries, and utility software for system administration.<<kernel-illumos>>

==== Linux Kernel
The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel. It was originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his i386-based PC, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, which was written to be a free (libre) replacement for Unix.<<kernel-linux>>
(((NT Kernel)))

=== Windows NT Kernel

The Windows NT kernel is a hybrid kernel; the architecture comprises a simple kernel, hardware abstraction layer (HAL), drivers, and a range of services (collectively named Executive), which all exist in kernel mode.<<kernel-win>>
